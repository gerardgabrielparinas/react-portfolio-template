title: My Exemplary Academic Works
tagline: The top one is expectedly my thesis.
preview: >-
  By far, what I would call my most exemplary academic work, my magnum opus,
  would be my thesis, considering that I did most of the work in terms of
  development, and my team members can attest to that.

# My Exemplary Academic Works

I'd rather make this part as concise as possible.

## GiveMore: My final capstone project

GiveMore is more than just a capstone project for me. This is my final work of development in Benilde, and I rightfully consider it as my magnum opus, despite it's flaws. GiveMore is a platform-as-a-Service system that serves as an online donation platform and record-keeping solution for charitable organizations. With a donor side and a charity side, the system offers a user-friendly interface for both donors and charity workers. Donors can access features such as donation forms and transparency-related functions, including viewing reports of donation statistics and details about past projects. It also includes a dashboard for the donors wherein they can access features for record-keeping and transparency. I can keep describing it here, but I feel like it would be much easier and exciting if you just [see for yourself](https://isproj2.vercel.app). I served as a full-stack developer of this project, and due reasons that I shall not disclose. ended up doing 65-75% of the actual development work. Thankfully, my team and I pulled it off, and we were even delighted to find out that we were eligible for a best capstone award (because there's only 1 other competitor), which this project has won.

### Flappy Box

My final project for our Fundamentals of Programming (FUNPROG) subject during my first year of college. Essentially a flappy bird rip-off that substitutes sprites and assets with drawn objects. Affectionately called "Flappy Box". This is the first and only game of my making. For now, at least. That depends on whether or not I pursue game design post-graduation. I don't know how to deploy windows forms apps so [just clone it](https://github.com/gerardgabrielparinas/FUNPROG_FINALS)?

### MOBDEVT Quiz App

A quiz app for our final output in our MOBDEVT class. [Here's the repository](https://github.com/gerardgabrielparinas/MOBDEVT_FINALS).

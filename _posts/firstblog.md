# It's really not what I expected.

When someone tells me about working at Makati, all I can visualize is the constant hassle of traffic, and expectedly, toxic work environments. So since the moment I finally submitted our thesis, I have been mentally preparing myself for this exact scenario. I had applied to, I would say, around 30 different companies, expecting to be rejected by most of them, and true enough, I did. However, one company decided to give me a shot. You can already guess which company it was. But that didn't sway me from my initial mindset. I started working here expecting the typical amounts of stress that came with an office job, but my expectations had been defied. Simply put, this company has a wonderful working environment, which is kind of rich, coming from someone who hasn't even graduated college yet. But I draw upon the little "work experience" I've had from college when I say that Gallium is one of the few environments wherein I experience very little stress, despite the challenging tasks. 

The commute was still a pain. If I'm to be honest, I'd say 90% of the distress that this internship gave me was from the commute alone. Then again, I'm in the Philippines, so this was still within my expectations.

## My Projects at Gallium.

Due to the length and scope of each project, I didn't really have a lot, but I will do my best to list them down.

### CV Generator App

This was a web app made for the HR people of Gallium31. The part I played in the development of this project was creating the backend/API for the CV Generator Module. What the CV Generator does is true to it's name. Essentially, it allows the HR Staff of Gallium31 to upload the CV of an interview candidate, and using Optical Character recognition combined with the power of OpenAI, the contents of their CV are automatically saved in Gallium's database for future use. Staying true to the "CV Generator Name,"  a new CV can also be generated through the saved data, and making use of a standard template provided by Gallium, which can then be downloaded in PDF format. It's through this project that we learned about development using Blitz.js, model-centric development as one of our seniors calls it, and as well as some version contol best practices.

### Employee CRUD

I would say that this was our practice project for the CV Generator that inevitably came afterwards. It is, as the name says, basic employee CRUD. This had no actual applications within the company, and served only as a proof of concept. Theoretically, it should've been much easier than our capstone project, due to it's very small scope. However, one thing I did not account for was that we would be using a different tech stack. It's still node.js, but for this project, I had to learn how to use nest.js, paired with mongoDB.

### Dockerizing Capstone Project

This was the very first assignment that we had been given. Literally the day after we've first been deployed (simply put our second day), we were told to do our research on Docker, what it does, and how it's used in the industry. After the research had been done, we were then tasked with downloading said tool, along with it's other dependencies, so we could have our first hands-on assignment - deploying our capstone project GiveMore to Docker. There was quite the learning curve, as we had to learn the basics such as the setup from scratch. Before that day, I didn't even know what a Dockerfile was, nor that yml files are an actual thing, but it's thanks to this assignment that I've gained new knowledge, which I now use on a daily basis during the development of our CV Generator and Candidate Management System. Aside from this, we've also learned how to use SSH to code remotely via a Digital Ocean droplet, and how to navigate and make use of Ubuntu to code, in combination with Docker.

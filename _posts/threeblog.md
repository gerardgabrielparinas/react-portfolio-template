  College life for me was, as expected, really not easy. It had it's highs and
  lows. However, I am confident in saying that I learned a lot from my stay in
  Benilde as an Information Systems student, and it has motivated me to better
  myself and become an achiever.

#My thoughts on college life

## Lessons Learned

To start this off, college has done to me what all my years of highschool had never done before - it pushed me to become an achiever. I'm currently a scholar, and it would've been sufficient to just get a bare minimum of 80% for all my subjects to maintain my scholarship, and then call it a day. That was exactly what I was supposed to do. But then I ended up doing the complete opposite. It's as if something inside of me was urging me to be better, to be an achiever for once in my life. And so I did. I worked hard, and I must say, the payoff is nice. For one, my group's thesis won the best capstone award, I managed to maintain my scholarship for the entirety of my college, I actually ***somehow*** survived being a student leader, and to top it all off, if this practicum goes well, I might be eligible to become a *cum laude*, and this brings me to one of the greatest lessons college has taught me - the importance of **diligence**. Interestingly enough, this ties into another great lesson taught to me in college, which was the importance of first learning how to be a good servant before you can be a good leader, which I had learned admittedly through the hard way, thanks to my years of participation in a student organization, which connects to lesson number three - **accountability**, and for this lesson, it makes itself very apparent during the thesis phase, and the OJT phase. Speaking of OJTs, although I won't go into too much detail, I cannot however, forget to mention all the technical skills that my program has taught me, for it is through those skills that I am finally getting closer and closer into being the fullstack developer that I aspire to be.

## Career Goals

The **me** from several months ago would've instantly answered with "I wanna be a QA tester!" or "I'm not quite sure yet..." when asked about his career goals. But that was before I discovered my passion for development, both through my capstone project, and later on, my experience with my OJT. As for my current career goals, it's my plan to continue working at Gallium31, hopefully being absorbed soon, and from there, it's just a matter of gaining experience. I have to admit, I haven't thought THAT far ahead, but I'd say that 5 years' worth of future career goals is more than enough for someone who hasn't even gotten their toga measurements taken yet.

## As a Developer

As a developer, I am dedicated to honing and perfecting my craft. To always improve my abilities, I am to remain up to speed on the newest software development technologies and processes. I will approach each assignment with a strong desire to solve problems, pay close attention to detail, and be innovative. I am committed to producing code that is clean, efficient, and maintainable while meeting the highest quality requirements. I plan to aggressively seek input from peers and mentors in order to learn and progress professionally. Furthermore, I am devoted to working successfully with team members, speaking openly, and providing solutions that surpass expectations. I hope to make a significant contribution to the field of software development by committing to excellence and continual progress.

As for what I plan to do after graduation... well, here's my list so far:

## My plans moving forward

1. Continue working at Gallium31 until my current project is finished
2. Take a several months-long vacation after finishing the project
3. Travel. Habang di pa busy
4. Once I get bored of not being plagued with stress, I'll open my own bank account
5. Take care of all the relevant Government IDs and such
6. Approach Sir Catayoc or Miss Cathie regarding the HiFi incubation of my capstone project
7. Go back to working for Gallium31
8. Refine my capstone project under the mentorship of HiFi (hopefully)
9. Enjoy life

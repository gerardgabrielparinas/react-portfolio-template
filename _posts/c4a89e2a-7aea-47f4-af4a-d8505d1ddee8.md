  My training as a developer isn't all that contributed to my growth as a

# Experiential Learning

## My time with AIM

The Association of Information Management (AIM) is the *only* student organization I've ever been involved in for the entirety of my college life. Well, I *was* technically under the SMIT SSG later on, but that's another can of worms. Putting it simply, my time in AIM is nothing short of wonderful. It was through this organization that I discovered skills that I never thought I had. Skills such as public speaking, handling events and projects, and even being the head of the organization. While it's true that I learned most, if not all of my technical skills thanks to my curricular activities, I picked up most of the soft skills that made me into who I am now, from this very organization. To think that it all started just because my dad told me to join. It was not easy, especially towards the end. The responsibilities increased as I climbed up in terms of position in the organization, and with every new position I took, all the more I grew as a person. It's from this organization that I learned one of my greatest lessons so far - the importance of good leadership.

## The National Innovation Summit by NEDA (I forgot what it was called)

This one was the ONLY actual contest I've been a part of wherein myself and my companions had to represent the college. You can imagine then that I was nervous, and rightfully so. In the event, what we had to do was, based on the given category, we were supposed to come up with a solution on how to innovate in said category. Sounds easy enough, right? But lo and behold - our category was ***very*** meta, as in "Innovating Innovations". I was rightfully confused back then, but we got back on track thanks to the guidance of sir Jacob Catayoc, our chaperone and mentor for the event. I am ashamed to admit that the details for the event are hazy at this point, but I still remember key moments. Like when I heard that PBBM would be giving the opening remarks. Now before anyone cancels me on this, let me reassure you that I am by no means a fan of him. Quite the opposite, in fact. But still, it's not everyday you breathe in the same air and germs as with the literal president of the Philippines, but I was disappointed to find out that his video message was, as the sentence says, a video message. But I digress. This event encouraged me to be a critical thinker, and to come out of my shell when it comes to contests like these. Prior to this, when it came to contests, I was typically a wallflower, so I wouldn't even dare to sign up. But that event just might have changed me. Another detail I vividly remember is that we lost to someone who was supposedly in the same category as us, but ***somehow*** got away with talking about *agriculture* of all things, despite that being a totally different category. I'm still salty about it to this very day. Our team would've been congratulated by the likes of Ayala and other big names, but we lost to someone who "innovated the field of innovations" by rambling on about kamote. (If you know sir Jake Catayoc, ask him about it). Still, I had fun despite it all, and it made me grow even more. Funnily enough, by the end of that day, I actually had a newfound appreciation for the taste of kamote.
